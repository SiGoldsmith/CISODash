# CISODash

A Cybersecurity Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) dashboard.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jccyberx/Cybether.git
cd cybether

# Start the application
./deploy.sh
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and login with:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## 🌐 Deploying with Custom Hostname

To deploy Cybether with a custom hostname:

```bash
# Deploy with hostname
./deploy.sh --hostname example.com
```

For local development with a hostname:

```bash
# On macOS
sudo ./macOS-setup-hosts.sh cybether.local
./deploy.sh --hostname cybether.local
```

Then access Cybether at http://cybether.local:3000

## 🔒 Changing the Default Password

For security, you should change the default admin password after first login. You can do this in two ways:

### Option 1: Using the Password Reset Script

```bash
# Make sure you have Python and required packages installed
pip install bcrypt psycopg2-binary python-dotenv

# Run the reset script
python reset_password.py
```

Follow the prompts to change the admin password.

### Option 2: Through the Database

```bash
# Connect to the database container
docker exec -it cybether-db psql -U postgres -d grc_dashboard

# Update the password (replace 'your-hashed-password' with the actual bcrypt hash)
UPDATE "user" SET password_hash = 'your-hashed-password' WHERE username = 'admin';
```
